# International-Space-Station-Tacker

This Pyhton project tracks the laitude and Longitude of the ISS and plots the coordinates on a map. 
Upon running the iss_tacker.py file, a HTML file will be generated. Open the HTML file using a web browser, and
a map, plotted with the location of the ISS, will be rendered.

This project was a lot of fun to build!
